* Some updates to the Rakefile and gemspec.

== 0.3.2 - 27-Apr-2008

* Internal cleanup only (now compiles cleanly with -W3).

== 0.3.0 - 30-Dec-2005
* The Struct::ChangeJournalStruct now contains a third member: path.  This
  is the full path to the file which was modified.  Thanks go to Stephen
  Haberman for the idea, and Heesob for the implementation.
* More tests added.
* Example script updated.

== 0.2.0 - 24-Apr-2005
* Modified ChangeJournal#wait to return an array of structs, rather than a
  single struct, because multiple events can be associated with a single
  action.
* Removed the changejournal.rd file.  The changejournal.txt file is rdoc
  friendly, so you can generate html from that if you wish.
* Fixed the release date for 0.1.0.
* Minor doc and test changes or updates.

* Initial release
