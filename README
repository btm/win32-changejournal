== Description
   A class for monitoring events related to files and directories on NTFS.

== Installation
=== Gem Installation
   gem install win32-changejournal
=== Local Installation
   rake install

== Synopsis
   require 'win32/changejournal'
   include Win32

   # Indefinitely wait for a change in 'C:\' and any of its
   # subdirectories. Print the file and action affected.
   cj = ChangeJournal.new("C:\\")

   cj.wait{ |array|
      array.each{ |info|
         p info.file_name
         p info.action
         p info.path
      }
   }

   cj.delete
	
== Notes
   Based on what the MSDN documentation says, this library requires NTFS, and
   should be preferred on that filesystem. On FAT filesystems, you should
   use the win32-changenotify library instead.

== Acknowledgements
   This library was originally based on the CJTest module by Jeffrey
   Cooperstein & Jeffrey Richter.
	
== Future Plans
   Add a method for iterating over all change records.

== Known Bugs  
   None that I know of. Please log any bug reports on the RubyForge
   project page at http://www.rubyforge.net/projects/win32utils
